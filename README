The main class for our edge matching algorithm is edgeMatching.m

It takes in two one parameter, a nxmx3 query image. Note that right now our algorithm is based on the images found in the /library folder and thus only works with images in our /query folder. 

Simply call edgeMatching(query) with a nxmx3 query image from our /query class and our matching algorithm should tell you whether the image is "Accurpril", "Vicodin", "Advil C&S", or "Ibuprofen"
